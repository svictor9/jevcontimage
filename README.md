Insert images from event descriptions into jevents modules

This Jevents plugin works in Jevents displays. It replaces the string JEV_CONTIMAGE in the display’s layout with the 1st content image found in the event's description. The images must be referenced as \<img\> tags in the event’s HTML description (what you usually get if you insert them with a text editor like TinyMCE or JCE). I use it with Jevents Latest Events module.

The plugin is a heavily simplified version of the Jevents Standard Images and Files (jevfiles).
